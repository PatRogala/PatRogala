# Patryk Rogala

> A software engineer with a passion for building solid backend systems in Ruby on Rails. I thrive on the dual challenge of modernizing large-scale legacy codebases and architecting clean, scalable applications from scratch. My curiosity for complex systems has also led me into game development with Unreal Engine 5, an experience that continually inspires my approach to creative problem-solving.
